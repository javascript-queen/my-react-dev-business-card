# my-react-dev-business-card

This project is important for every React dev who wants to understand:

- custom components

- JSX

- Styling with classes

- Routers

Here's my small react app with a business card. I used router, too, btw. Just to make things a bit more interesting and complicated. 

So, first, you'll be headed to a main page of the app describing some cool React facts.

Then you can check out my small card. It's simple but important to know for a React dev.
